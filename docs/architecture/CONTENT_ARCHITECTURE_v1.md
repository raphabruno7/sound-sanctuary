## Relationship Between Sound Healing and System Nervous Theme
- Sound Healing is the service modality.
- System Nervous theme is the educational and framing layer that explains why the modality matters.
- Information model: 
  - Sound Healing page answers “what and how.”
  - Sessions page answers “which format and next step.”
  - Home and About answer “why this practitioner and why now.”
- Messaging dependency: System Nervous framing should introduce regulation goals; Sound Healing content should map practices to those goals without clinical claims.

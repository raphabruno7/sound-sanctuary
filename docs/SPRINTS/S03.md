# Sprint S03 — Consolidation After Design-System v5.3 Propagation

## Sprint Goal
Consolidate S03 execution now that `design-system` v5.3 and dark-mode foundations are already delivered, and finish the remaining UI alignment and QA gates without introducing new visual inventions.

## Current Baseline (Already Delivered)
- Centralized design source of truth is active via `./design-system` submodule.
- Canonical token import is in place (`design-system/styles/dist/tokens.css`), with consumer-local `:root` token blocks removed.
- Dark-mode foundation is delivered and available in the shared shell.
- Primary route structure exists for `/sound-healing`, `/sessions`, `/contact`, `/newsletter`.

## Remaining Scope
- Apply canonical recipes/tokens to shared shell and primary conversion CTAs:
  - `SiteHeader`
  - `SiteFooter`
  - primary CTAs on `/`, `/sessions`, `/sound-healing`
- Define and run a visual regression checklist for light/dark on critical routes.
- Keep S03 backlog explicitly ordered by technical dependencies and release gates.

## Out of Scope
- Inventing new visual language outside design-system recipes/tokens.
- New dependencies.
- Schema/Convex changes.
- Motion/animation additions.
- Refactors unrelated to shell/CTA alignment and QA gates.

## Task Status Snapshot
- `S03-0001` DONE — Architect module/page outlines.
- `S03-0002` DONE — Copy scaffolding for primary routes.
- `S03-0003` DONE — `/sound-healing` structure.
- `S03-0004` DONE — `/sessions` structure + `/contact` flow.
- `S03-0005` DONE — `/portfolio` minimal structure.
- `S03-0006` DONE — Route/release hygiene alignment.
- `S03-0007` DONE — Mobile-first content integrity baseline.
- `S03-0008` DONE — Design-system v5.3 propagation + dark-mode foundation.
- `S03-0009` TODO — Apply canonical recipes/tokens to header/footer/primary CTAs.
- `S03-0010` TODO — Visual regression checklist (light/dark) on critical pages.
- `S03-0011` TODO — Dependency-gated release checklist and final readiness sign-off.

## Dependency Order (Execution)
1. `S03-0009` must land first to standardize shared shell + CTA surfaces.
2. `S03-0010` runs after `S03-0009` to validate the final visual state in both themes.
3. `S03-0011` runs last as release-gate documentation and sign-off package.

## Definition of Done
- Remaining S03 tasks (`S03-0009`, `S03-0010`, `S03-0011`) are completed in order.
- Light/dark checklist covers all critical routes with pass/fail evidence.
- No duplicate local tokens are reintroduced in consumer repo.
- `./scripts/agent_check.sh` passes for each implementation PR.

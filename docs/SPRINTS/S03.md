# Sprint S03 — Briefing v5 to Executable Content Plan (No Design System Yet)

## Sprint Goal
Convert BRIEFING v5 into a concrete, engineering-usable plan: page/module definitions, copy scaffolding, and implementation tasks to build primary conversion pages (mobile-first) while preserving strict scope boundaries.

## In Scope
- Page/module plan for primary routes:
  - `/` (home structure already defined; only follow-on refinements if needed)
  - `/sound-healing`
  - `/sessions`
  - `/contact` (CTA destination verification only)
- Secondary route scaffolding plan:
  - `/about`, `/portfolio`, `/newsletter`, `/privacy`
- Copy scaffolding (headings, section intent, bullet-level content)
- Media slots as placeholders (structural only)
- Release hygiene updates only if required by new routes (metadata/robots/sitemap)

## Out of Scope
- Design system (colors, typography system, spacing tokens)
- Motion/animation
- New dependencies
- Schema/Convex changes
- Unrelated refactors

## Tasks
- S03-0001: Architect - Define content modules + page outlines (v1)
- S03-0002: Copy - Draft structural copy scaffolding for `/sound-healing` and `/sessions`
- S03-0003: UI - Implement `/sound-healing` page structure (no design system)
- S03-0004: UI - Implement `/sessions` page structure + CTA to `/contact` (no design system)
- S03-0005: UI/Content - Portfolio page minimal structure (entries + placeholders)
- S03-0006: Release - Ensure sitemap/robots/metadata cover new/updated routes (strict scope)
- S03-0007: QA - Mobile-first content integrity pass + scope policing

## Dependencies
- S03-0001 must land before S03-0003/S03-0004/S03-0005 (UI implementation depends on the module/page outlines).
- S03-0002 should land before S03-0003/S03-0004 (to prevent UI shipping placeholders that contradict the copy plan).
- S03-0006 depends on S03-0003/S03-0004/S03-0005 (release hygiene must reflect actual routes).
- S03-0007 should run after S03-0003/S03-0004/S03-0006.

## Definition of Done
- Each task ships as one branch -> one PR -> Supervisor conclusion (MERGE/REQUEST CHANGES/BLOCKED).
- All PRs run `./scripts/agent_check.sh` successfully.
- No design system work, no new dependencies, no schema changes.
- Conversion flow integrity preserved: `/` -> `/sound-healing` -> `/sessions` -> `/contact`.

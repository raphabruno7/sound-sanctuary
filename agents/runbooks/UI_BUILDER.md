# Runbook — UI Builder

## Responsibilities
- Implement pages/components per IA.
- Maintain minimal visual language: whitespace, typography, subtle motion.
- Ensure mobile-first behavior and accessibility.

## Guardrails
- Avoid cards/icons/placeholders that feel like SaaS.
- Prefer a few large images to many small ones.
- Motion: fade-in, slow transitions only.

## Definition of Done
- Passes lint/build
- Looks correct on mobile/tablet/desktop
- No layout shift / no broken overflow

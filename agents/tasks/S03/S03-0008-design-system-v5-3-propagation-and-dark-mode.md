# Task: S03-0008 — Baseline Delivered: Design-System v5.3 Propagation + Dark-Mode Foundation

## Assigned Agent Role
UI

## Goal
Record the delivered S03 baseline that moved the consumer to centralized design-system v5.3 tokens and enabled dark-mode foundation.

## Scope (files/pages)
- Historical baseline record only (already delivered in prior PRs).
- Canonical references:
  - `design-system/styles/dist/tokens.css`
  - `design-system/styles/dist/base.css`
  - `src/app/globals.css`
  - shared shell components (`SiteHeader`, `ThemeToggle`)

## Constraints
- No new implementation in this card.
- Do not re-open local token definitions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Marked as delivered baseline in sprint planning.
- Used as dependency context for S03-0009 onward.

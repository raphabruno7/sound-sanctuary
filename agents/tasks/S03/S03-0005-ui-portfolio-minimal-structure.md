# Task: S03-0005 — UI/Content: Portfolio Minimal Structure (Placeholders Allowed)

## Assigned Agent Role
UI

## Goal
Implement a minimal `/portfolio` structure that supports trust-building without requiring a data model (static placeholders acceptable).

## Scope (files/pages)
- `src/app/portfolio/page.tsx`

## Constraints
- Structural only.
- No schema/Convex changes (static content only).
- No new dependencies.
- Avoid refactors to shared components unless required for structure.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Page exists at `/portfolio` with a clear structure for entries (even if placeholder).
- Links/CTAs back into conversion path where appropriate (`/sessions` or `/contact`).
- `./scripts/agent_check.sh` passes.

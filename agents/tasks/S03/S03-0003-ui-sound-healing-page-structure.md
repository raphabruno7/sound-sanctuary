# Task: S03-0003 — UI: Implement /sound-healing Structure (No Design System)

## Assigned Agent Role
UI

## Goal
Implement the `/sound-healing` page as a structural, mobile-first page following the modules/outlines defined in S03-0001 and copy scaffolding from S03-0002.

## Scope (files/pages)
- `src/app/sound-healing/page.tsx`
- Optional: minimal nav link updates if required to expose the route

## Constraints
- Structural only (headings, section grouping, semantic layout).
- No palette/typography system decisions.
- No motion/animation.
- No new dependencies.
- No schema/Convex changes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Page exists at `/sound-healing` and matches the approved outline.
- Content is grounded; no clinical claims.
- `./scripts/agent_check.sh` passes.

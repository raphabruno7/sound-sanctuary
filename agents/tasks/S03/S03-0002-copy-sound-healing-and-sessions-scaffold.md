# Task: S03-0002 — Copy: Structural Copy Scaffolding (Sound Healing + Sessions)

## Assigned Agent Role
Copy

## Goal
Draft structural copy scaffolding (headings + short paragraphs + bullet lists) for `/sound-healing` and `/sessions` aligned to the nervous system framing, without adding clinical claims.

## Scope (files/pages)
- Docs only (no code):
  - Create `docs/copy/S03_sound_healing.md`
  - Create `docs/copy/S03_sessions.md`
- Must map to modules/outlines from S03-0001.

## Constraints
- No design system work.
- No new dependencies.
- No schema/Convex changes.
- Avoid clinical claims; keep language grounded.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Each page doc includes H1/H2 + section headings + paragraph/bullet drafts.
- Includes explicit CTA copy to `/contact`.
- Notes any open decisions (pricing/duration/logistics placeholders).
- `./scripts/agent_check.sh` passes.

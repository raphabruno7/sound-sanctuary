# Task: S03-0004 — UI: Implement /sessions Structure + CTA to /contact

## Assigned Agent Role
UI

## Goal
Implement the `/sessions` page structure (formats + expectations) with a clear primary CTA to `/contact`.

## Scope (files/pages)
- `src/app/sessions/page.tsx`
- Optional: minimal nav link updates if required to expose the route

## Constraints
- Structural only (no design system work).
- Keep format details as placeholders if still open (duration/pricing).
- No new dependencies.
- No schema/Convex changes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Page exists at `/sessions` and matches the approved outline/modules.
- Primary CTA routes to `/contact`.
- `./scripts/agent_check.sh` passes.

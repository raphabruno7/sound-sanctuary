# Task: S03-0007 — QA: Mobile-First Content Integrity + Scope Policing

## Assigned Agent Role
QA

## Goal
Run a mobile-first QA pass ensuring content integrity, conversion flow clarity, and strict adherence to task scope (no design system drift).

## Scope (files/pages)
- Review deployed pages locally:
  - `/`, `/sound-healing`, `/sessions`, `/portfolio`, `/about`, `/newsletter`, `/contact`, `/privacy`
- Validate against:
  - `docs/QA_RELEASE.md`
  - `docs/SPRINTS/S03.md`

## Constraints
- Do not change code; file issues as checklist comments for follow-up PRs.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Reports a short checklist with pass/fail and concrete notes per page.
- Flags any non-scope changes observed in PRs.

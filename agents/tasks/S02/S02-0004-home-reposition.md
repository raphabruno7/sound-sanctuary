# Task: S02-0004 — Home Reposition as Sound Healing Core

## Goal Note
Reposition the Home page (/) to clearly present Sound Healing as the core offer,
explicitly linking sound + nervous system.

## Scope (strict)
- src/app/page.tsx (structure + headings + copy scaffolding)
- update CTAs to point to /contact (and optionally /portfolio)

## Out of scope
- palette, typography system, animations
- new dependencies
- Convex/schema changes

## Acceptance
- H1 mentions Sound Healing
- Clear section headings:
  - Sound and the Nervous System
  - What Happens in a Session
  - Session Formats
  - Who It Is For
- ./scripts/agent_check.sh passes

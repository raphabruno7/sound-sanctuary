# Task: Replace hero gradient with real photography (minimal + calm)

## Context
Current hero uses a placeholder gradient. Replace with real photography using `next/image` and maintain calm readability.

## Scope
- [ ] Add a hero image file strategy (local `public/` for v0)
- [ ] Use `next/image` in Home hero
- [ ] Add subtle overlay for text readability
- [ ] Keep motion minimal (optional fade-in)

## Out of scope
- Complex gallery system
- Image CDN/storage integration (later)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Hero displays a real image on all breakpoints
- [ ] Text remains readable (no harsh overlays)
- [ ] `npm run lint` and `npm run build` pass
